## A Repository of Solutions to Online Judge Problems
The goal of this repository is to contain reasonably efficient and readable solutions to 
problems found on https://onlinejudge.org/   

## Conventions
Each solution is contained within its own subdirectory.  It is &lt;CamelCaseProblemName&gt;&lt;Problem Number&gt; with non-alphanumeric characters substituted with "_" and spaces removed.  This is done to ensure we have a valid filesystem name.

As an example, problem 615 - Is It A Tree? becomes IsItATree_615.
